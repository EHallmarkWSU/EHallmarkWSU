**EHallmarkWSU/EHallmarkWSU** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸŽ“ I am currently majoring in Computer Science

ðŸ–¥ Throughout last semester I worked on four projects for my 1180 Computer Science class. Of the four, my two favorites were "Simon Says" and "Choose Your Own Adventure."

"Simon Says' had an easy and hard mode. The easy mode had you repeat numbers and each round was cumalative, so previous numbers would be added on to the next round until you lose. The hard mode had you repeat colors, which was also cumalative until lost.

"Choose Your Own Adventure" had you go through a possible "Day in My Life" type of story. A lot of the prompts included interests of myself, especially with video games or hanging out with friends. There are 6 endings, some good, some bad.
